    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bite with your back teeth first.</p>
    <p>Or else.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Glutinous rice, sticky rice flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ginger Syrup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Sweet osmanthus</li>
        <li>Screwpine or pandan leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly toast the black sesame seeds over medium fire until you smell the aroma of the black sesame seeds. Please take note that the sesame seeds will start popping when they are heated, so use your lid to cover. Don't burn the black sesame seeds; transfer them out and let cool as soon as they smell aromatic.</li>
        <li>Use a mini food processor to grind the black sesame seeds until they become fine. Transfer the ground black sesame into a wok, add sugar and butter and stir well to form a thick paste. If they are too dry, add more butter. Dish out and let cool in the fridge. (This will make the filling easier.)</li>
        <li>In a big bowl, mix the glutinous rice flour with water until it forms a smooth paste and no longer sticks to your hands. Divide it equally into 16-20 balls (depends how you like the size, the bigger the size, the easier it is to do the filling). Flatten each ball in your palm, and then use a pair of chopsticks to pick up some black sesame paste and lay it in the middle of the flatten ball. Fold the edge to seal the dumpling. Lightly roll it into a ball shape using both palms, very gently and delicately. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the ginger syrup by boiling the water. Add the ginger and screwpine/pandan leaves (optional) into the water and boil for 10-15 minutes with medium heat. Add sugar and sweet osmanthus and boil for another 5 minutes. Lower heat to simmer and reduce to about 4 cups of water. Add more sugar to taste if you like.</li>
        <li>Heat up another pot of boiling water. Drop the dumplings into the hot boiling water. As soon as they float to the top, transfer them out and into the ginger syrup. Turn off heat and serve the black sesame dumplings in a bowl immediately.</li>
    </ol>
